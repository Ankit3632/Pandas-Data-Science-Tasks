# Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks
Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

# Project Summary
we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

"*" Drop NaN values from DataFrame
Removing rows based on a condition
